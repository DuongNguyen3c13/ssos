 * Service provider for Authlete.

 * instance which implements the AuthleteApi interface.
 *
 * It is expected that this service provider is listed in the `providers`
 * array in `config/app.php` like the following.
 *
 * ```
 * 'providers' => [
 *     // Other Service Providers
 * 
 *     Authlete\Laravel\Provider\AuthleteServiceProvider::class,
 * ],
 * ```
 *
 * If the version of Laravel is 5.5 or higher, this service provider will
 * be automatically detected thanks to the feature of 'auto-discovery'.
 * Therefore, you don't have to modify `config/app.php` to add this service
 * provider manually.
 *
 * The `boot()` method of this service provider registers some commands for
 * "php artisan authlete:*".
