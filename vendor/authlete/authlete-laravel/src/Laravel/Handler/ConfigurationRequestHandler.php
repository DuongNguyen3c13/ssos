/**
 * Handler for requests to a configuration endpoint.
 *
 * An OpenID provider that supports
 * [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)
 * provides an endpoint that returns its configuration information in JSON
 * format. Details about the format are described in
 * [3. OpenID Provider Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata)
 * of [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).
 *
 * Note that the URI of an OpenID provider configuration endpoint is defined in
 * [4.1. OpenID Provider Configuration Request](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfigurationRequest).
 * In short, the URI must be:
 *
 * ```
 * {Issuer-Identifier}/.well-known/openid-configuration
 * ```
 *
 * "{Issuer-Identifier}" is a URL to identify an OpenID provider. For example,
 * `https://example.com`. For details about Issuer Identifier, see the
 * description about the `issuer` metadata defined in
 * [3. OpenID Provider Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata)
 * of [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html)
 * and the `iss` claim in
 * [2. ID Token](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken)
 * of [OpenID Connect Core 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).
 *
 * You can change the Issuer Identifier of your service by using the management
 * console ([Service Owner Console](https://www.authlete.com/documents/so_console)).
 * Note that the default value of Issuer Identifier is not appropriate for
 * production use, so you should change it.
